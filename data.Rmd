```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(tidyverse)
require(lattice)
```

```{r}
Homers_data <- read.csv(file="Homers_data.csv")
my1000 <- sample(Homers_data$kkardashtemp ,size = 1000, replace=T)
densityplot(my1000,main="original data")

```

According to this density plot we can see that there are two peaks which means it is bimodel. This means there is bimodel distribution.
